# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

CloudSecure AI SOC is designed for educational and demonstration purposes to teach cybersecurity concepts. This document outlines security considerations, responsible disclosure, and best practices.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notice

**This project contains intentionally vulnerable configurations for educational purposes.**

- **DO NOT** deploy this in production environments without proper security hardening
- **DO NOT** use this against systems you don't own or lack permission to test
- **ALWAYS** follow your organization's security policies
- **ALWAYS** conduct proper security reviews before any deployment

## üîí Security Features

### Built-in Security Controls

- **Network Segmentation**: VPC with public/private subnets
- **Security Groups**: Restrictive firewall rules
- **AWS WAF**: Web application firewall protection
- **GuardDuty**: AI-powered threat detection
- **CloudTrail**: API call auditing
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Network traffic monitoring
- **Encryption**: Data encryption at rest and in transit

### Intentional Vulnerabilities (For Educational Purposes)

The demo environment includes some intentionally permissive configurations:

- **Open Security Groups**: Some ports open for demonstration
- **Public EC2 Instances**: Target servers in public subnets
- **Weak Passwords**: Default passwords for demo purposes
- **Broad CIDR Blocks**: Some rules allow wider access for testing

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover security vulnerabilities in this project:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability publicly
3. **DO** email the maintainers privately with details
4. **DO** allow reasonable time for assessment and fixes

### What to Include

When reporting security issues, please provide:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Affected versions and configurations
- **Recommendations**: Suggested fixes if you have them

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity and complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available and tested

## üîß Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Environment Isolation**

   - Use dedicated AWS accounts for testing
   - Never test against production systems
   - Implement proper network isolation

2. **Credential Management**

   - Use AWS IAM roles instead of access keys when possible
   - Rotate credentials regularly
   - Never commit credentials to version control
   - Use AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data

3. **Access Control**

   - Implement least privilege principles
   - Use specific IP ranges in `allowed_cidr_blocks`
   - Enable MFA for AWS accounts
   - Regular access reviews

4. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Enable CloudTrail in all regions
   - Monitor GuardDuty findings
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms
   - Regular log reviews

### For Contributors

1. **Code Security**

   - Never commit real credentials
   - Use placeholder values in examples
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Follow secure coding practices

2. **Infrastructure Security**

   - Use latest Terraform provider versions
   - Implement proper resource tagging
   - Enable encryption by default
   - Regular security reviews

3. **Documentation**
   - Document security implications
   - Provide security warnings
   - Include hardening recommendations
   - Update security documentation

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardening for Production Use

If you want to adapt this for production use, consider:

### Network Security

- Remove public IP assignments
- Implement NAT gateways for outbound traffic
- Use private subnets for all compute resources
- Implement network ACLs
- Enable VPC Flow Logs

### Access Control

- Implement strict security group rules
- Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager instead of SSH
- Enable AWS Config for compliance monitoring
- Implement resource-based policies

### Data Protection

- Enable encryption for all data stores
- Use AWS KMS for key management
- Implement backup and recovery procedures
- Enable versioning for S3 buckets

### Monitoring and Alerting

- Enable GuardDuty in all regions
- Set up Security Hub for centralized findings
- Implement custom CloudWatch metrics
- Configure SNS notifications for alerts

### Compliance

- Enable AWS Config rules
- Implement AWS CloudFormation drift detection
- Regular compliance assessments
- Document security controls

## üìã Security Checklist

Before deploying, ensure:

- [ ] All default passwords changed
- [ ] IP restrictions properly configured
- [ ] Latest AMIs and container images used
- [ ] Encryption enabled for all data stores
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested
- [ ] Security groups follow least privilege
- [ ] IAM roles and policies reviewed
- [ ] CloudTrail enabled and configured
- [ ] GuardDuty enabled and monitored

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Security Scanning

Consider using:

- **Terraform Security**: tfsec, Checkov, Terrascan
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy, Clair, Snyk
- **SAST**: SonarQube, CodeQL, Semgrep
- **Dependency Scanning**: npm audit, pip-audit

### Manual Security Reviews

Regular reviews should include:

- Infrastructure configuration review
- IAM permissions audit
- Network security assessment
- Data flow analysis
- Threat modeling exercises
