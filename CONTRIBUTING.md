# Contributing to CloudSecure AI SOC

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CloudSecure AI SOC! This project is designed to help cybersecurity professionals learn about security monitoring, AI-powered threat detection, and cloud security best practices.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Terraform >= 1.0 installed
- Basic understanding of AWS services (VPC, EC2, ECS, GuardDuty)
- Familiarity with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Set up the backend infrastructure (S3 bucket and DynamoDB table)
3. Create your own `terraform.tfvars` file
4. Test the deployment in your own AWS account

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Contribute

- **Security Enhancements**: Better security configurations
- **Documentation**: README updates, guides, tutorials
- **Monitoring**: New Grafana dashboards, alerts
- **Attack Simulations**: Additional demo scenarios
- **Bug Fixes**: Issues with deployment or functionality

### Development Workflow

1. **Fork the Repository**

   ```bash
   git fork https://github.com/original-owner/cloudsecure-ai-soc.git
   cd cloudsecure-ai-soc
   ```

2. **Create a Feature Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**

   - Follow existing code style and patterns
   - Test changes in your own AWS environment
   - Update documentation as needed

4. **Test Your Changes**

   ```bash
   cd terraform/environments/demo
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   # Run tests and verification
   terraform destroy
   ```

5. **Commit Your Changes**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add descriptive commit message"
   ```

6. **Push and Create Pull Request**

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards

- **Terraform**: Follow HashiCorp's style guide
- **Documentation**: Use clear, concise language
- **Security**: Always consider security implications
- **Testing**: Test all changes in your own environment

### Terraform Best Practices

- Use meaningful resource names with consistent prefixes
- Include proper tagging for all resources
- Use variables instead of hard-coded values
- Include outputs for important resource information
- Add comments for complex configurations

### Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This project contains intentionally vulnerable configurations for educational purposes.

- **Never** commit real credentials or sensitive information
- **Always** use placeholder values in example files
- **Document** any intentional vulnerabilities clearly
- **Test** security configurations thoroughly

### Documentation Requirements

- Update README.md if adding new features
- Include inline comments for complex code
- Provide examples for new configurations
- Update architecture diagrams if needed

## üêõ Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:

- **Environment**: AWS region, Terraform version, OS
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Clear steps to replicate the issue
- **Expected Behavior**: What should happen
- **Actual Behavior**: What actually happens
- **Error Messages**: Full error logs if applicable
- **Configuration**: Relevant terraform.tfvars (sanitized)

### Issue Templates

- **Bug Report**: For deployment or functionality issues
- **Feature Request**: For new capabilities or improvements
- **Security Issue**: For security-related concerns (use private disclosure)

## üîí Security Disclosure

If you discover security vulnerabilities, please:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Send details to the maintainers privately
3. Allow time for assessment and fixes
4. Follow responsible disclosure practices
